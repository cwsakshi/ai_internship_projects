# AI Internship â€” Two Complete Projects (10-Day Plan)

This package contains two end-to-end projects you can complete and publish in ~10 days:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction** â€” classification (EDA, modeling, metrics)
2. **Sales Forecasting** â€” time series (EDA, SARIMAX, forecast vs actual)

## How to use (Step-by-step)
1. Install dependencies in a fresh environment (Conda or venv):

   ```bash
   pip install -r customer_churn/requirements.txt
   pip install -r sales_forecasting/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open notebooks inside each project's `notebooks/` folder and run in order.
3. Replace the synthetic CSVs in each `data/` folder with your real datasets when ready (keep column names similar or adjust the code).
4. Export key charts/images and paste into each project's README before publishing to GitHub.
5. Create a LinkedIn post summarizing problem, approach, and results with GitHub links.

## Suggested 10-Day Schedule
- **Day 1â€“2:** Load data, clean, and EDA (both projects)
- **Day 3â€“4:** Churn models + evaluation + plots
- **Day 5â€“6:** Forecast models + evaluation + plots
- **Day 7â€“8:** Polish notebooks, add insights, and finalize READMEs
- **Day 9â€“10:** Push to GitHub and post on LinkedIn

Good luck! Youâ€™ve got this ðŸš€
